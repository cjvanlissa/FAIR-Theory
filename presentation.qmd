Asking a scientist what a theory is, is a bit like asking a fish about water.

::: {.incremental}

**Predictive**
: Theories predict phenomena (Popper, Hempel, van Fraassen).

**Explanatory**
: Theories explain phenomena (Hempel, Cartwright, Bohm).

**Guiding Research**
: Theories guide future research (Kuhn, Lakatos).

**Organizing Knowledge**
: Theories organize knowledge (Quine, Putnam).

**Practical Utility**
: Theories serve as tools with practical utility in the scientific endeavor (Feyerabend, van Fraassen).

Predictive 
: Theories provide predictions that can be tested and refined (Popper, Hempel, van Fraassen).

## {.center}

Explanatory 
: Theories offer explanations for phenomena, helping to make sense of the world (Hempel, Cartwright, Bohm).

## {.center}

Guiding Research 
: Theories guide scientific research by setting the agenda for normal science or research programs (Kuhn, Lakatos).

Organizing Knowledge
: Theories organize and integrate knowledge within a broader conceptual framework (Quine, Putnam).

Practical Utility
: Theories serve as tools with practical utility in various contexts, depending on the needs of the scientific endeavor (Feyerabend, van Fraassen).

Frazzled scientists are requesting that everyone please stop generating hypotheses for a little bit while they work through the backlog.

## {.incremental}

* 89.6% of published studies tests hypotheses [@kuhbergerPublicationBiasPsychology2014].
* only 15% of deductive studies even reference specific theories [@mcphetresDecadeTheoryReflected2021].
* a theory crisis has been proclaimed by @scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2021
* "Theories are rarely developed in a way that indicates an accumulation of knowledge." --- @robinaughInvisibleHandsFine2021

## {.incremental}

* "I argue that most claims in the literature are so critically underspecified that attempts to empirically evaluate them are doomed to failure---they are not even wrong." --- @scheelWhyMostPsychological2022
* "Nevertheless, the picture painted by Meehl (1978) more than 40 years ago was a bleak one, and we believe this portrait depicts much of the modern psychological landscape." --- @Proulx2021

## Who is to blame? {.center}

Researchers must develop better, harder, faster, stronger theories by really trying their best.

# We need better [tools]{.highlight}.

### Open Science is a success story of better tooling

::: {.incremental}

* Open Data is enabled by research data repositories
* Open Code is driven by widespread availibility of open source software
* Open Access is only thinkable because of extensive infrastructure
* Preregistration is becoming popular(-ish) because of tutorials and plattforms

### Formalization

> „Crucially, scientific models are expressed in unambiguous language such that **anyone can interpret the model and its claims about the world**. Contrary to mental models (which live in a person’s mind), scientific models are **transparent and public** (that is, external) representations.”

# FAIR Theory Utopia

## Theories are no longer toothbrushes

> "[Theories are] like toothbrushes --- no self-respecting person wants to use anyone else’s" 

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @mischelToothbrushProblem2008
:::

## Theories may die as heroes

> "[...] notice what happens to theories. [...] They never die, they just slowly fade away."

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @Meehl1978
:::

## Studies may become polygam

> "Progress in science depends on more than just a play of ideas; it requires the proliferation of theories and the acceptance of alternatives."

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @feyerabend1970
:::

## Theories may have families

> "The jingle-jangle problem permeates psychological research."

> "We will call these overlapping but distinct constructs 'sibling constructs.' This term captures the fact that the constructs share a close, familial relation, but are not identical; that is, they are not 'twin constructs.'

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @Lawson2021
:::

## Theories may get a history

> A research programme is successful if its theoretical growth anticipates its empirical growth; that is, if new facts are discovered with its help.

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @lakatos1976history
:::

## Utopia Summary

* theories are developed collaboratively
* theories are connected to
  * their past versions
  * other theories
  * empirical observations

## Help needed

* a great example is a didactical goldmine
* do you know a theory, that is:
  * easy to understand
  * has changed over time
  * is neither to vague nor to formal
