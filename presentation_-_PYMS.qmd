Asking a scientist what a theory is, is a bit like asking a fish about water.

**Predictive**
: Theories predict phenomena (Popper, Hempel, van Fraassen).

**Explanatory**
: Theories explain phenomena (Hempel, Cartwright, Bohm).

**Guiding Research**
: Theories guide future research (Kuhn, Lakatos).

**Organizing Knowledge**
: Theories organize knowledge (Quine, Putnam).

**Practical Utility**
: Theories serve as tools with practical utility in the scientific endeavor (Feyerabend, van Fraassen).

Predictive 
: Theories provide predictions that can be tested and refined (Popper, Hempel, van Fraassen).

## {.center}

Explanatory 
: Theories offer explanations for phenomena, helping to make sense of the world (Hempel, Cartwright, Bohm).

Guiding Research

Practical Utility

# How are we doing?

:::: {.content-hidden when-meta="short"}


## {.incremental}

* 89.6% of published studies tests hypotheses [@kuhbergerPublicationBiasPsychology2014].
* only 15% of deductive studies even reference specific theories [@mcphetresDecadeTheoryReflected2021].
* a theory crisis has been proclaimed by @scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2021
* "Theories are rarely developed in a way that indicates an accumulation of knowledge." --- @robinaughInvisibleHandsFine2021

## {.incremental}

* "most claims in the literature are so critically underspecified that attempts to empirically evaluate them are doomed to failure---they are not even wrong." --- @scheelWhyMostPsychological2022
* "Nevertheless, the picture painted by Meehl (1978) more than 40 years ago was a bleak one, and we believe this portrait depicts much of the modern psychological landscape." --- @Proulx2021

## Applying Open Science to Theory Specification

::: {.incremental}

*	Open science practices have improved many areas of research, 
but not theory development.
* *Open Data* is enabled by research data repositories
* *Open Code* is driven by widespread availibility of open source software
* *Open Access* is only thinkable because of extensive infrastructure
* *Hypothesis testing* is improved by preregistration and replication

# FAIR Theory Utopia

## Theories are no longer toothbrushes

> "[Theories are] like toothbrushes --- no self-respecting person wants to use anyone else’s" 

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @mischelToothbrushProblem2008
:::

## Theories may die as heroes

> "[...] notice what happens to theories. [...] They never die, they just slowly fade away."

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @Meehl1978
:::

## Studies may become polygam

> "Progress in science depends on more than just a play of ideas; it requires the proliferation of theories and the acceptance of alternatives."

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @feyerabend1970
:::

## Theories may have families

> "The jingle-jangle problem permeates psychological research."

> "We will call these overlapping but distinct constructs 'sibling constructs.' This term captures the fact that the constructs share a close, familial relation, but are not identical; that is, they are not 'twin constructs.'

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
--- @Lawson2021
:::

## Theories may get a history

> A research programme is successful if its theoretical growth anticipates its empirical growth; that is, if new facts are discovered with its help.
