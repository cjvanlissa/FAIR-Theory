## Overview

**Proposition-Based Theory Specification (PBTS)** (Glöckner & Fiedler):

1. Source selection
2. Propositions/implications
3. Definitions
4. Problems

Unique contribution:

- Create a **FAIR** theory (Van Lissa et al., 2025)

## Why SDT?

*The role of fathers’ versus mothers’ parenting in emotion-regulation development from mid–late adolescence*  
([Van Lissa et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000612))

```

## Why FAIR Theory?

> *"There's nothing as useful as a good theory"* (William James)

* What use does theory serve in my work? Nothing practical
* More like a "framework" to contextualize the work

```{r}

## "Theory Crisis" in Psychology

* 89.6% of published studies tests hypotheses [@kuhbergerPublicationBiasPsychology2014].
* only 15% of deductive studies even reference specific theories [@mcphetresDecadeTheoryReflected2021].
* most claims [are] so critically underspecified that attempts to empirically evaluate them are doomed to failure - they are **not even wrong**." [@scheelWhyMostPsychological2022]
* "Theories are rarely developed in a way that indicates an accumulation of knowledge." [@robinaughInvisibleHandsFine2021]

## The Solution: FAIR Theory

* Open science practices have improved many areas of research
* Let's apply them to theory as well

[**F**]{.highlight}indability, [**A**]{.highlight}ccessibility, [**I**]{.highlight}nteroperability, and [**R**]{.highlight}euse of

[**information artifacts**]{.highlight}


## What kind of Theories?
 
- IF/THEN propositions (as in PBST)
- Directed Acyclic Graphs
- Nomological Networks
- Formulas
- Axiomatic Systems
- Computer Programs
- Simulation Models

---

## [F]{.highlight}indable 

- In standardized, FAIR-compliant repository, like Zenodo (which integrates with OSF)
- Indexed and searchable
- With abundant metadata describing the theory and its provenance
- Via persistent identifier, or DOI

## [A]{.highlight}ccessible

- Plain text, human- and machine-readable file types
- Everyone knows how to, and ideally can, access the theory
- The theory is a distinct resource, separate from (but possibly related to) a paper or book (chapter)


## [I]{.highlight}nteroperable

- Interoperability: the property of information artifacts to “integrate or work together [...] with minimal effort” (M. D. Wilkinson et al., 2016). 
-  Use formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
    + Lengthy prose/schematic drawings fall short of this
- Use standardized vocabularies/ontologies that also follow FAIR principles
- X-interoperable: *Interoperable for what*?
    + Document *how* a theory is interoperable for specific purposes 

## [R]{.highlight}eusable {.center auto-animate="true"}

- Legally and practically reusable
- Appropriate (permissive) license
- Meet domain-relevant community standards
- Detailed provenance, referencing ancestors

## FAIR Theory Utopia {.smaller}

* No more toothbrushes
	+ "[Theories are] like toothbrushes --- no self-respecting person wants to use anyone else’s" [@mischelToothbrushProblem2008]
* Let a thousand flowers bloom: 
	+ "Progress in science depends on more than just a play of ideas; it requires the proliferation of theories and the acceptance of alternatives." (Feyerabend, 1970)
* But kill your darlings: 
	+ "theories [...] never die, they just slowly fade away." [@meehlTheoreticalRisksTabular1978]
* Theories have families, similar in form (analogical modeling) and similar in topic, but using different terms (jingle-jangle fallacies)
* Theories have a history, a full timeline of their ancestry and development
* Automatic tests can be run on all available datasets, pitting theories against each other in an ongoing manner (leaderboard/integration testing)


# FAIRifying Self-Determination Theory

## Step 1 - Select Sources

- SDT chapter: @deciSelfDeterminationTheory2012 in @vanlangeHandbookTheoriesSocial2012  
- Also considered <https://selfdeterminationtheory.org>
    * ~same theory, different prose
- Also considered five "mini theories"
    * _"we have developed five mini-theories to address different, though related, issues"_
    * Main theory is already sufficiently complex
    * Not clear how the mini-theories fit with main SDT

## Step 1 - Select Sources 2

Coders identify **snippets**:

```{r eval = TRUE}
SDT1 <- read.csv(system.file("sdt1.txt", package = "theorytools"))
names(SDT1) <- c("N", "IF", "THEN", "Original")
# Show first snippet (source text)
unique(SDT1[, "Original", drop = TRUE])
```

---

## Step 2 - IF–THEN Propositions

<font size=4>

```{r eval = TRUE}
knitr::kable(SDT1[, 1:4], caption = "SDT translated into IF/THEN statements")
```

</font>

---

## Step 3 - Definitions

<font size=4>

```{r eval = TRUE}
definitions <- read.csv(system.file("sdt_definitions.csv", package = "theorytools"))
knitr::kable(definitions[, -c(1,3,4)], caption = "Operationalizations of constructs in SDT")
```

</font>

---



## Step 4 - Auxiliary Assumptions

Not applicable, skip

---

## Step 5 - Problems

* **Redundancy/tautology**
    + Prose easily translates to IF/THEN propositions
    + Each proposition is illustrated multiple times, usually in the positive and negative sense
* **Underspecified**: None of the constructs are defined, often not even in referenced sources.
* Compound statements; many IF/THEN propositions in one sentence, which makes them hard to disentangle

## Issues experienced

* Disagreement about selection of sources
  + Especially main theory/mini-theories
* Disagreement about how to unpack compound sentences containing more than one IF/THEN statements
* Limitation of PBTS
  + IF/THEN format is binary
  + Well-suited to experiments, not to probabilistic of dose/response relationships

## From IF–THEN to DAG

* IF–THEN statements imply a causal connection

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(theorytools)
library(dagitty)
edges_raw <- read.csv(system.file("sdt.txt", package = "theorytools"))
SDT <- unique(edges_raw[, 2:3])
knitr::kable(SDT)
```


---

## Turn Into DAG

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
SDT <- dagitty::dagitty(
  paste0("dag {",
  paste0(SDT$from, " -> ", SDT$to, collapse = "\n"),
  "}")
)
SDT
```

## Step 4 — Make It FAIR

Package SDT as a **FAIR theory**:


```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(theorytools)
create_fair_theory(
  path = "SDT",
  title = "Self-Determination Theory",
  theory_file = c("sdt.txt", "definitions.csv"),
  remote_repo = "self_determination_theory",
  add_license = "cc0"
)
```

---

## README Highlights (Interoperability)

* **`sdt.txt`**: DAG, with instructions for **causal inference** & **data simulation**
* **`definitions.csv`**: Construct definitions (current gaps noted)
* **Related works**: Deci & Ryan (2012), other references
* **License**: CC0, or copy-left (explicit waiver of copyright)

## Interoperability

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(theorytools)
download_theory(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15648655)
```

---

## Interoperability: Plotting

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
tidySEM::graph_sem(SDT)
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(tidySEM)
library(ggplot2)
# Specify plot layout
lo <- get_layout(
"EE", "",   "IN", "WB",
"",   "LC", "",   "",
"NE", "",   "IM", "HD",
  rows = 3
)
# Rename nodes
renam <- c(EE = "external_event", NE = "needs", IN = "integration", WB = "wellbeing", 
           LC = "locus_of_causality", HD = "healthy_development", IM = "intrinsic_motivation")
lo[match(names(renam), lo)] <- renam
# Prepare the graph
p <- prepare_graph(SDT, layout = lo, angle = 179, text_size = 3, rect_width = 1.5, spacing_x = 2.5)

# Change node shape
p$nodes$shape <- "rect"
# Change node labels
renam <- c(external_event = "external\nevent", needs = "needs", integration = "integration", wellbeing = "wellbeing", 
           locus_of_causality = "locus of\ncausality", healthy_development = "healthy\ndev.", intrinsic_motivation = "intrinsic\nmotivation")
p$nodes$label <- renam[p$nodes$name]
# Plot the graph
plot(p)
```

## Interoperability: Control Variables

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Select covariates for causal inference
library(dagitty)
adjustmentSets(SDT,
               exposure="intrinsic_motivation",
               outcome="wellbeing")
#> { needs }
```



## Interoperability: Simulate Data

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Simulate data
simulate_data(SDT, n = 497)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# Simulate data
round(simulate_data(SDT, n = 5), 2)
```

## Interoperability: Power Analysis

```{r echo=TRUE}
sdt_coef <- dagitty('dag {
intrinsic_motivation -> wellbeing [beta=.4]
needs -> wellbeing [beta=.2]
}')

set.seed(1)
prop.table(
table(
replicate(
  n = 100,
  {
    df_sim <- simulate_data(sdt_coef, n = 200)
    summary(lm(wellbeing ~ ., df_sim))$coefficients[2, 4] < .05
  }
)
)
)
```
