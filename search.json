    "text": "presentation\npresentation_-_ESCOP_2\npresentation_-_FGT\n\nWe introduce the concept of FAIR theories, reimagining theories as dynamic, evolving entities collaboratively developed and refined, thus contributing to a more robust and interconnected body of scientific knowledge. Theories help to structure and condense the existing scientific knowledge, yet their development often lacks structure. We propose FAIR theories, hoping that a more structured approach to theory development enables more cumulative science. Central to our proposal is representing theories as digital objects expressed in formal languages, such as formulas, mathematical/statistical models, computer programs, nomological networks, or operational definitions. However, digital representation is not enough; in our framework, the theory’s history is tracked using version control and semantic versioning, and the relation between theories with universally unique identifiers. Combining these identifiers with rich metadata makes a FAIR theory Findable; tracking it via version control makes it Accessible; the formal language makes it Interoperable; and well-defined procedures for changing and amending theories make it Reusable. FAIR theories facilitate metascientific insights into the evolution of theories and their empirical support, ultimately enabling theory curation. Moving forward, we envision theories undergoing “integration tests against reality”, paralleling continuous integration in software development by continuously evaluating the empirical foundations of theories, akin to living meta-analyses. This presentation addresses the guiding principles of FAIR theory and provides specific implementation examples."
